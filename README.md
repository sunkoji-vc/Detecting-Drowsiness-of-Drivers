# Detecting-Drowsiness-of-Drivers
The driver fatigue is an important issue in many vehicle accidents. According

to the National Highway Safety Administration, drowsy driving causes more than

100,000 crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 death toll each year in India.

Earlier approach normally based on DriCare technique, detects the driverâ€™s

fatigue status, such as yawning, blinking, and duration of eye closure, using video

images, without equipping their bodies with devices. This approach uses KCF

(Kernelized Correlation Filter) and CNN (Convolution neural network) algorithms.

The proposed work is based on the issues related to driver drowsiness detection

and alert system. The proposed algorithm uses the features of deep convolutional neural

network-like RESNET (Residual neural network) and MC-KCF (Multi Convolution

neural network-KCF). These techniques are used to detect driver drowsiness by

measuring yawning, head position and eye rotation.
